<h3>About me</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; color:DarkSlateBlue">
	Before joining Startup Institute in New York, I was an accomplished Corporate Banker and Credit Risk Manager with a focus in Leverage Finance for the Communications, Media and Entertainment sectors. After 8+ years in various positions (Portfolio Management, Credit Transaction Management, and Risk Management), I felt the urge to pursue something creative and relevant in today's technology focused culture. After dabbling in part-time courses in UX Design and Product Management at General Assembly, I finally made the decision to leave banking and enrolled full-time at Startup Institute.

<br>
	As a persistent worker with a problem-solving attitude, I put my absolute best into everything I do. My intensive work experience in corporate banking and ongoing studies in product/web design will equip me to handle anything that gets thrown my way.
