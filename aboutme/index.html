	Before joining Startup Institute in New York, I was an accomplished Corporate Banker and Credit Risk Manager with a focus in Leverage Finance for the Communications, Media and Entertainment sectors. After 8+ years in various positions at ABN AMRO N.V., RBS Americas, and RBC Capital Markets, I felt the urge to pursue something creative and relevant in today's technology focused culture. After dabbling in part-time courses in UX Design and Product Management at General Assembly, I finally made the decision to leave banking and enrolled full-time at Startup Institute.

	As a persistent worker with a problem-solving attitude, I put my absolute best into everything I do. My intensive work experience in corporate banking and ongoing studies in product/web design will equip me to handle anything that gets thrown my way.
